In this project, I have scrapped the laptop details from flipkart website and inferred various information about Laptops. 
Like on the website which configuration is majorly present and in that Configuration, pick out top 3 pocket friendly laptop brands with good ratings. 
This will give the idea of what’s the configuration of most laptops displayed on flipkart. 
If the configuration is latest then, the user will have all the options with top 3 affordable brands by his budget and the user can choose the desired laptop and no need to scroll next page as this takes the laptops from all the pages and shortlists it thus saving the time of user and giving information about what’s latest.

Note: If You Run The Webscraping part, you may need to clean your dataset seperately depending on your dataset structutre after values are fetched from webiste. I suggest start looking over the part where flipkart_scraped_data.csv is imported in Flipkart_Webscraping_Data_Cleaning_Part_1.ipynb and from there Our Data cleaning starts and In the Next Part i.e Part 2,The Exploratory data Analysis is done.


Instructions:
	1.Load The Csv files in jupyter first.
	2.Read the Note at top of Part_1 jupyter file i.e in Flipkart_Webscraping_Data_Cleaning_Part_1.ipynb
