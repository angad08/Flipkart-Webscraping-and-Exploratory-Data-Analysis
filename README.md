# Webscraping-with-EDA
In this project, I have scrapped the laptop details from flipkart website and inferred various information about Laptops that could be explored and inferred. Like on the website which configuration is majorly present and in that Configuration, pick out top 3 pocket friendly laptop brands with good ratings. This will give the idea of what’s the configuration of most laptops displayed on flipkart. If the configuration is latest then, the user will have all the options with top 3 affordable brands by his budget and the user can choose the desired laptop and no need to scroll next page as this takes the laptops from all the pages and shortlists it thus saving the time of user and giving information about what’s displayed in latest.
